# Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone: Chemo Scheduling Support
## <ins>Overview</ins>


This repository contains the final Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone Project focused on chemotherapy scheduling and infusion chair utilization challenges in an oncology setting. This project demonstrates how cloud services can be integrated to support operational decision-making related to nurse capacity constraints and inaccurate chemotherapy chair-time estimates.

This is a learning tool that uses data created for practice. It does not contain any real personal information. It highlights the use of cloud storage, serverless compute, managed databases, and basic analytics to create an end-to-end healthcare operations workflow.

**Cloud Platform Used:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### 4. Reflection
 The reflection answers the below questions:
 
- Which parts of the design you feel most confident about, and which parts you are least sure about.
- At least one alternative architecture you considered and why you did *not* choose it.
- If you had 4–8 more weeks and unlimited credits, what next steps you would implement.

**Deliverable file:**

- `reflection.md`
